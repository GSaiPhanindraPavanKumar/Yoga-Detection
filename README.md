1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GSaiPhanindraPavanKumar/Yoga-Detection.git
   cd Yoga-Detection
   ```

2. **Create virtual environment** (recommended)
   ```bash
   python -m venv yoga_detection_env
   source yoga_detection_env/bin/activate  # On Windows: yoga_detection_env\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install required packages**
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python
   pip install mediapipe
   pip install tensorflow
   pip install numpy
   pip install matplotlib
   pip install jupyter
   pip install torch torchvision  # For YOLOv5
   pip install ultralytics  # YOLOv5 dependencies
   ```

4. **Download model weights** (if not included)
   - The repository includes `yolov5s.pt` pre-trained weights
   - Additional models can be downloaded from the YOLOv5 repository

## üíª Usage

### Quick Start

1. **Run the main application**
   ```bash
   cd UI_UX
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Use Jupyter Notebooks for experimentation**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   # Open any of the .ipynb files to explore the functionality
   ```

### Available Notebooks

- **`Dataset preparation.ipynb`**: Prepare and preprocess yoga pose datasets
- **`Model testing.ipynb`**: Test and evaluate trained models
- **`pose_physioNet.ipynb`**: Advanced pose analysis using PhysioNet techniques
- **`yoga pose.ipynb`**: Interactive yoga pose detection and analysis

### Example Usage

```python
# Basic pose detection example
import cv2
import mediapipe as mp

# Initialize MediaPipe pose detection
mp_pose = mp.solutions.pose
pose = mp_pose.Pose()

# Load and process image
image = cv2.imread('yoga_pose.jpg')
results = pose.process(cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB))

# Extract pose landmarks
if results.pose_landmarks:
    # Process landmarks for pose classification
    landmarks = results.pose_landmarks.landmark
    # Add your pose classification logic here
```
